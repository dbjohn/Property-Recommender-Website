Property recommender website project

This is the Ruby on Rails project that is part of the final year project completed for my Computer Science Degree. The other main part of the project is the modified OpenTripPlanner fork at https://github.com/dbjohn/OpenTripPlanner. 

The aim of the project was to develop a property website that can combine user defined preferences and input with utilising existing published data about complex public transport networks and local amenities to identify and rank properties suitable to the user. Particular interest is focused on finding suitable properties with minimised commute time to a workplace. The implementation uses among other tools: Ruby-on-Rails, PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, OpenTripPlanner (for public transport routing), OpenLayers.  

Further details about the project can be found in the file instructions.txt which was submitted along with the relevant subset of the project.  Require further information or any questions, email johndbrennan at gmail.com
